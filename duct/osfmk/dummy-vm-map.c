/*
 *	Virtual memory maps provide for the mapping, protection,
 *	and sharing of virtual memory objects.  In addition,
 *	this module provides for an efficient virtual copy of
 *	memory from one map to another.
 *
 *	Synchronization is required prior to most operations.
 *
 *	Maps consist of an ordered doubly-linked list of simple
 *	entries; a single hint is used to speed up lookups.
 *
 *	Sharing maps have been deleted from this version of Mach.
 *	All shared objects are now mapped directly into the respective
 *	maps.  This requires a change in the copy on write strategy;
 *	the asymmetric (delayed) strategy is used for shared temporary
 *	objects instead of the symmetric (shadow) strategy.  All maps
 *	are now "top level" maps (either task map, kernel map or submap
 *	of the kernel map).  
 *
 *	Since portions of maps are specified by start/end addreses,
 *	which may not align with existing map entries, all
 *	routines merely "clip" entries to these start/end values.
 *	[That is, an entry is split into two, bordering at a
 *	start or end value.]  Note that these clippings may not
 *	always be necessary (as the two resulting entries are then
 *	not changed); however, the clipping is done for convenience.
 *	No attempt is currently made to "glue back together" two
 *	abutting entries.
 *
 *	The symmetric (shadow) copy strategy implements virtual copy
 *	by copying VM object references from one map to
 *	another, and then marking both regions as copy-on-write.
 *	It is important to note that only one writeable reference
 *	to a VM object region exists in any map when this strategy
 *	is used -- this means that shadow object creation can be
 *	delayed until a write operation occurs.  The symmetric (delayed)
 *	strategy allows multiple maps to have writeable references to
 *	the same region of a vm object, and hence cannot delay creating
 *	its copy objects.  See vm_object_copy_quickly() in vm_object.c.
 *	Copying of permanent objects is completely different; see
 *	vm_object_copy_strategically() in vm_object.c.

 * vm_map_swapin/vm_map_swapout
 *
 * Swap a map in and out, either referencing or releasing its resources.  
 * These functions are internal use only; however, they must be exported
 * because they may be called from macros, which are exported.
 *
 * In the case of swapout, there could be races on the residence count, 
 * so if the residence count is up, we return, assuming that a 
 * vm_map_deallocate() call in the near future will bring us back.
 *
 * Locking:
 *	-- We use the map write lock for synchronization among races.
 *	-- The map write lock, and not the simple s_lock, protects the
 *	   swap state of the map.
 *	-- If a map entry is a share map, then we hold both locks, in
 *	   hierarchical order.
 *
 * Synchronization Notes:
 *	1) If a vm_map_swapin() call happens while swapout in progress, it
 *	will block on the map lock and proceed when swapout is through.
 *	2) A vm_map_reference() call at this time is illegal, and will
 *	cause a panic.  vm_map_reference() is only allowed on resident
 *	maps, since it refuses to block.
 *	3) A vm_map_swapin() call during a swapin will block, and 
 *	proceeed when the first swapin is done, turning into a nop.
 *	This is the reason the res_count is not incremented until
 *	after the swapin is complete.
 *	4) There is a timing hole after the checks of the res_count, before
 *	the map lock is taken, during which a swapin may get the lock
 *	before a swapout about to happen.  If this happens, the swapin
 *	will detect the state and increment the reference count, causing
 *	the swapout to be a nop, thereby delaying it until a later 
 *	vm_map_deallocate.  If the swapout gets the lock first, then 
 *	the swapin will simply block until the swapout is done, and 
 *	then proceed.
 *
 * Because vm_map_swapin() is potentially an expensive operation, it
 * should be used with caution.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *	1) A map with a residence count of zero is either swapped, or
 *	   being swapped.
 *	2) A map with a non-zero residence count is either resident,
 *	   or being swapped in.

 *
 *	Description:
 *		Copy the memory described by the map copy
 *		object (copy; returned by vm_map_copyin) onto
 *		the specified destination region (dst_map, dst_addr).
 *		The destination must be writeable.
 *
 *		Unlike vm_map_copyout, this routine actually
 *		writes over previously-mapped memory.  If the
 *		previous mapping was to a permanent (user-supplied)
 *		memory object, it is preserved.
 *
 *		The attributes (protection and inheritance) of the
 *		destination region are preserved.
 *
 *		If successful, consumes the copy object.
 *		Otherwise, the caller is responsible for it.
 *
 *	Implementation notes:
 *		To overwrite aligned temporary virtual memory, it is
 *		sufficient to remove the previous mapping and insert
 *		the new copy.  This replacement is done either on
 *		the whole region (if no permanent virtual memory
 *		objects are embedded in the destination region) or
 *		in individual map entries.
 *
 *		To overwrite permanent virtual memory , it is necessary
 *		to copy each page, as the external memory management
 *		interface currently does not provide any optimizations.
 *
 *		Unaligned memory also has to be copied.  It is possible
 *		to use 'vm_trickery' to copy the aligned data.  This is
 *		not done but not hard to implement.
 *
 *		Once a page of permanent memory has been overwritten,
 *		it is impossible to interrupt this function; otherwise,
 *		the call would be neither atomic nor location-independent.
 *		The kernel-state portion of a user thread must be
 *		interruptible.
 *
 *		It may be expensive to forward all requests that might
 *		overwrite permanent memory (vm_write, vm_copy) to
 *		uninterruptible kernel threads.  This routine may be
 *		called by interruptible threads; however, success is
 *		not guaranteed -- if the request cannot be performed
 *		atomically and interruptibly, an error indication is
 *		returned.
