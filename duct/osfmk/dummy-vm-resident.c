/*
 *  CONTIGUOUS PAGE ALLOCATION
 *
 *  Find a region large enough to contain at least n pages
 *  of contiguous physical memory.
 *
 *  This is done by traversing the vm_page_t array in a linear fashion
 *  we assume that the vm_page_t array has the avaiable physical pages in an
 *  ordered, ascending list... this is currently true of all our implementations
 *  and must remain so... there can be 'holes' in the array...  we also can
 *  no longer tolerate the vm_page_t's in the list being 'freed' and reclaimed
 *  which use to happen via 'vm_page_convert'... that function was no longer
 *  being called and was removed...
 *
 *  The basic flow consists of stabilizing some of the interesting state of
 *  a vm_page_t behind the vm_page_queue and vm_page_free locks... we start our
 *  sweep at the beginning of the array looking for pages that meet our criterea
 *  for a 'stealable' page... currently we are pretty conservative... if the page
 *  meets this criterea and is physically contiguous to the previous page in the 'run'
 *  we keep developing it.  If we hit a page that doesn't fit, we reset our state
 *  and start to develop a new run... if at this point we've already considered
 *  at least MAX_CONSIDERED_BEFORE_YIELD pages, we'll drop the 2 locks we hold,
 *  and mutex_pause (which will yield the processor), to keep the latency low w/r
 *  to other threads trying to acquire free pages (or move pages from q to q),
 *  and then continue from the spot we left off... we only make 1 pass through the
 *  array.  Once we have a 'run' that is long enough, we'll go into the loop which
 *  which steals the pages from the queues they're currently on... pages on the free
 *  queue can be stolen directly... pages that are on any of the other queues
 *  must be removed from the object they are tabled on... this requires taking the
 *  object lock... we do this as a 'try' to prevent deadlocks... if the 'try' fails
 *  or if the state of the page behind the vm_object lock is no longer viable, we'll
 *  dump the pages we've currently stolen back to the free list, and pick up our
 *  scan from the point where we aborted the 'current' run.
 *
 *
 *  Requirements:
 *      - neither vm_page_queue nor vm_free_list lock can be held on entry
 *
 *  Returns a pointer to a list of gobbled/wired pages or VM_PAGE_NULL.
